# Memory Game Project


## Introduction

This was one of the projects in the Udacity Front End Web Devloper course. We received an initial starter project with some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game. Our task was to convert this from a static project to an interactive one, by both modifying the HTML and CSS and writing the JavaScript. 

### Known Bugs

FIXED: when there is only one card open, the user can keep clicking on it and the step count keeps incrementing.
